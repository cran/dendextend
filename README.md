# dendextend

## Introduction

Class "dendrogram" provides general functions for handling tree-like structures. It is intended as a replacement for similar functions in hierarchical clustering and classification/regression trees, such that all of these can use the same engine for plotting or cutting trees.

However, many basic features are still missing from the dendrogram class.  This package aims at filling in some gaps.


## Motivation

Extending R core dendrogram functions.

## Installation

To install the stable version on CRAN:

```r
# install.packages('dendextend') # not yet available from CRAN
```

To install the GitHub version:

```r
if (!require('installr')) install.packages('installr'); require('installr')
# the installr includes the "require2" function
## install.Rtools() # run this if you are using Windows and don't have Rtools
require2(devtools)
install_github('talgalili/dendextend')
require2(Rcpp)
install_github('talgalili/dendextendRcpp')

# Having colorspace is also useful, since it is used
# In various examples in the vignettes
require2(colorspace)
```

And then you may load the package using:
```r
library(dendextend)
# library(dendextendRcpp) # loads by itself, if installed.
# And you might also wish to load:
library(colorspace)
```
