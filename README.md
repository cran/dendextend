## Introduction

Class "dendrogram" provides general functions for handling tree-like structures in R. It is intended as a replacement for similar functions in hierarchical clustering and classification/regression trees, such that all of these can use the same engine for plotting or cutting trees.

However, many basic features are still missing from the dendrogram class.  This package aims at filling in some gaps.


## Motivation

Extending R core dendrogram functions.

## Installation

To install the stable version on CRAN:

```r
install.packages('dendextend')
install.packages('dendextendRcpp')
```

To install the GitHub version:

```R
install.packages.2 <- function (pkg) if (!require(pkg)) install.packages(pkg);
install.packages.2('devtools')
install.packages.2('Rcpp')
# make sure you have Rtools installed first! if not, then run:
#install.packages('installr'); install.Rtools()
devtools::install_github('talgalili/dendextend')
devtools::install_github('talgalili/dendextendRcpp')

# Having colorspace is also useful, since it is used
# In various examples in the vignettes
install.packages.2('colorspace')
```

And then you may load the package using:

```R
library("dendextend")
library("dendextendRcpp")
```
