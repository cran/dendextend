\title{Adjust the order of one dendrogram based on another (using labels)}
\usage{
match_order_by_labels(dend_change, dend_template,
  check_that_labels_match = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend_change}{tree object (dendrogram)}

\item{dend_template}{tree object (dendrogram)}

\item{check_that_labels_match}{logical (TRUE). If to check that the labels
in the two dendrogram match. (if they do not, the function aborts)}
}
\value{
Returns dend_change after adjusting its order values to
 be like dend_template.
}
\description{
Takes one dendrogram and adjusts its order leaves valeus based on the order
of another dendrogram. The values are matached based on the labels of the
two dendrograms.

This allows for faster \link{entanglement} running time, since we can be 
sure that the leaves order is just as using their labels.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{

dend <- USArrests[1:4,] \%>\% dist \%>\% hclust \%>\% as.dendrogram
order.dendrogram(dend) #  c(4L, 3L, 1L, 2L)

dend_changed <- dend
order.dendrogram(dend_changed) <- 1:4
order.dendrogram(dend_changed) # c(1:4)

# now let's fix the order of the new object to be as it was:
dend_changed <- match_order_by_labels(dend_changed, dend)
# these two are now the same:
order.dendrogram(dend_changed)
order.dendrogram(dend))
