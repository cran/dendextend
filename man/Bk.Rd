\title{Bk - Calculating Fowlkes-Mallows Index for two dendrogram}
\usage{
Bk(tree1, tree2, k, include_EV = TRUE, warn = dendextend_options("warn"),
  ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree1}{a dendrogram/hclust/phylo object.}

\item{tree2}{a dendrogram/hclust/phylo object.}

\item{k}{an integer scalar or vector with the desired number 
of cluster groups.
If missing - the Bk will be calculated for a default k range of
2:(nleaves-1).
No point in checking k=1/k=n, since both will give Bk=1.}

\item{include_EV}{logical (TRUE). Should we calculate expectancy and variance
of the FM Index under null hypothesis of no relation between the clusterings?
If TRUE (Default) - then the \link{FM_index_R} function, else (FALSE)
we use the (faster) \link{FM_index_profdpm} function.}

\item{warn}{logical (default from dendextend_options("warn") is FALSE).
Set if warning are to be issued, it is safer to keep this at TRUE,
but for keeping the noise down, the default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{Ignored (passed to FM_index_R/FM_index_profdpm).}
}
\value{
A list (of k's length) of Fowlkes-Mallows index between two dendrogram for 
a scalar/vector of k values.
The names of the lists' items is the k for which it was calculated.
}
\description{
Bk is the calculation of Fowlkes-Mallows index for a series of k cuts 
for two dendrograms.
}
\details{
From Wikipedia:

Fowlkes-Mallows index (see references) is an external evaluation method 
that is used to determine the similarity between two clusterings
(clusters obtained after a clustering algorithm). This measure of similarity
could be either between two hierarchical clusterings or a clustering and
a benchmark classification. A higher the value for the Fowlkes-Mallows index
indicates a greater similarity between the clusters and the benchmark 
classifications.
