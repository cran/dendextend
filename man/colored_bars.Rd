\title{Add colored bars to a dendrogram}
\source{
This function is based on the \link[moduleColor]{plotHclustColors} from the
{moduleColor} R package. It was modified so that it would
work with dendrograms (and not just hclust objects), as well allow to
add the colored bars on top of an existing plot (and not only as a seperate plot).

See: \url{http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/moduleColor/}
For more details.
}
\usage{
colored_bars(colors, dend, rowLabels = NULL, cex.rowLabels = 0.9,
  add = TRUE, y_scale = 1, y_shift = 0, text_shift = 1, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{colors}{Coloring of objects on the dendrogram. Either a vector (one color per object)
or a matrix (can also be an array or a data frame)
with each column giving one color per object.
Each column will be plotted as a horizontal row of colors
under the dendrogram.}

\item{dend}{a dendrogram object. If missing, the colors are plotted without and re-ordering
(this assumes that the colors are already ordered based on the dend's labels)}

\item{rowLabels}{Labels for the colorings given in \code{colors}. The labels will be printed to the
left of the color rows in the plot. If the argument is given, it must be a vector of length
equal to the number of columns in \code{colors}. If not given, \code{names(colors)}
will be used if available. If not, sequential numbers
starting from 1 will be used.}

\item{cex.rowLabels}{Font size scale factor for the row labels. See \code{\link[graphics]{par}}.}

\item{add}{logical(TRUE), should the colored bars be added to an existing
dendrogram plot?}

\item{y_scale}{how much should the bars be stretched on the y axis?}

\item{y_shift}{where should the bars be plotted underneath the x axis?}

\item{text_shift}{a dendrogram object}

\item{...}{ignored at this point.}
}
\value{
An invisible vector/matrix with the ordered colors.
}
\description{
Add colored bars to a dendrogram, usually
corresponding to either clusters or some outside
categorization.
}
\details{
You will often needs to adjust the y_scale, y_shift and the text_shift
parameters, in order to get the bars in the location you would want.

(this can probably be done automatically, but will require more work.
since it has to do with the current mar settings,
the number of groups, and each computer's specific graphic device.
patches for smarter defaults will be appreciated)

\examples{
\dontrun{

rows_picking <- c(1:5, 25:30)
dend <- (iris[rows_picking,-5]*10) \%>\% dist \%>\% hclust \%>\% as.dendrogram
odd_numbers <- rows_picking \%\% 2
cols <- c("gold", "grey")[odd_numbers+1]
# scale is off
plot(dend)
colored_bars(dend, cols)
# move and scale a bit
plot(dend)
colored_bars(dend, cols, y_shift = -1,
             rowLabels = "Odd\\n numbers")
# Now let's cut the tree and add that info to the plot:
k2 <- cutree(dend, k = 2)
cols2 <- c("#0082CE", "#CC476B")[k2]
plot(dend)
# sadly, the shift paramteres need to be handled manually...
colored_bars(dend, cbind(cols2, cols), y_shift = -1,
             rowLabels = c("2 clusters", "Odd numbers"),
             text_shift = 1)

# let's add clusters color
# notice how we need to play with the colors a bit
# this is because color_branches places colors from
# left to right. Which means we need to give colored_bars
# the colors of the items so that ofter sorting they would be
# from left to right. Here is how it can be done:
the_k <- 3
cols3 <- rainbow_hcl(the_k, c=90, l=50)
dend \%>\% update("branches_k_color", k = the_k, with = cols3) \%>\% plot

kx <- cutree(dend, k = the_k)
ord <- order.dendrogram(dend)
kx  <- sort_levels_values(kx[ord])
kx  <- kx[match(seq_along(ord), ord)]

colored_bars(dend, cbind(cols3[kx], cols2, cols),
             y_shift = -1, y_scale = 1.4,
             rowLabels = c("3 clusters", "2 clusters", "Odd numbers"),
             text_shift = 1)
