\alias{lowest_common_branch}
\title{Find lowest common branch were the two items are shared}
\usage{
lowest_common_branch(item1, item2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{item1}{a named numeric vector (of cluster group with names of k level)}

\item{item2}{a named numeric vector (of cluster group with names of k level)}

\item{...}{not used}
}
\value{
The first location (from left) where the two vectors have the same A dendrogram, after adjusting the members attr in all of its nodes.
}
\description{
Given two vectors, for two items, of cluster belonging - the function finds
the lowest branch (e.g: largest number of k clusters) for which the two
items are in the same cluster for the two trees.

\examples{

item1 <- structure(c(1L, 1L, 1L, 1L), .Names = c("1", "2", "3", "4"))
