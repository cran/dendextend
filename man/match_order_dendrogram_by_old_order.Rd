\title{Adjust the order of one dendrogram based on another (using order)}
\usage{
match_order_dendrogram_by_old_order(dend_change, dend_template,
  dend_change_old_order, check_that_labels_match = FALSE,
  check_that_leaves_order_match = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend_change}{tree object (dendrogram)}

\item{dend_template}{tree object (dendrogram)}

\item{dend_change_old_order}{a numeric vector with the order of leaves in
dend_change (at least before it was changes for some reason).
This is the vector based on which we adjust the new values of dend_change.}

\item{check_that_labels_match}{logical (FALSE). If to check that the labels
in the two dendrogram match. (if they do not, the function aborts)}

\item{check_that_leaves_order_match}{logical (FALSE). If to check that 
the order in the two dendrogram match. (if they do not, the function aborts)}
}
\value{
Returns dend_change after adjusting its order values to
 be like dend_template.
}
\description{
Takes one dendrogram and adjusts its order leaves valeus based on the order
of another dendrogram. The values are matached based on the order of the
two dendrograms.

This allows for faster \link{entanglement} running time, since we can be 
sure that the leaves order is just as using their labels.

This is a function is FASTER than \link{match_order_by_labels}, but it 
assumes that the order and the labels of the two trees are matching!!

This will allow for a faster calculation of \link{entanglement}.

\examples{
\dontrun{

dend <- USArrests[1:4,] \%>\% dist \%>\% hclust \%>\% as.dendrogram
order.dendrogram(dend) #  c(4L, 3L, 1L, 2L)


# Watch this!
dend_changed <- dend
dend_changed <- rev(dend_changed)
expect_false(identical(order.dendrogram(dend_changed), order.dendrogram(dend)))
# we keep the order of dend_change, so that the leaves order are synced
# with their labels JUST LIKE dend:
old_dend_changed_order <- order.dendrogram(dend_changed)   
# now we change dend_changed leaves order values:
order.dendrogram(dend_changed) <- 1:4
# and we can fix them again, based on their old kept leaves order:
dend_changed <- match_order_dendrogram_by_old_order(dend_changed, dend, 
                                                     old_dend_changed_order)
expect_identical(order.dendrogram(dend_changed), order.dendrogram(dend))
