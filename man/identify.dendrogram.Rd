\title{Identify Clusters in a Dendrogram (not hclust)}
\source{
This function is based on \link{identify.hclust}, with slight modifications
to have it work with a dendrogram, as well as adding "horiz"
}
\usage{
\method{identify}{dendrogram}(x, FUN = NULL, N = 20, MAXCLUSTER,
  DEV.FUN = NULL, horiz = FALSE, stop_if_out = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a \link{dendrogram} object.}

\item{FUN}{(optional) function to be applied to the index numbers of the 
data points in a cluster (see 'Details' below).}

\item{N}{the maximum number of clusters to be identified.}

\item{MAXCLUSTER}{the maximum number of clusters that can be produced by 
a cut (limits the effective vertical range of the pointer).}

\item{DEV.FUN}{(optional) integer scalar. If specified, the corresponding 
graphics device is made active before FUN is applied.}

\item{horiz}{logical (FALSE), indicating if the rectangles 
should be drawn horizontally or not (for when using 
plot(dend, horiz = TRUE) ) .}

\item{stop_if_out}{logical (default is FALSE). This default makes the function
NOT stop if k of the locator is outside the range (this default is different than the behavior
of the identify.hclust function - but it is nicer for the user.).}

\item{...}{further arguments to FUN.}
}
\value{
(Invisibly) returns a list where each element contains a vector
 of data points contained in the respective cluster.
}
\description{
Just like \link{identify.hclust}:
reads the position of the graphics pointer when the (first) 
mouse button is pressed. It then cuts the tree at the vertical
 position of the pointer and highlights the cluster containing 
 the horizontal position of the pointer. Optionally a function is applied
 to the index of data points contained in the cluster.
}
\details{
By default clusters can be identified using the mouse and an invisible 
list of indices of the respective data points is returned.
If FUN is not NULL, then the index vector of data points is passed to this
 function as first argument, see the examples below. The active 
 graphics device for FUN can be specified using DEV.FUN.
 The identification process is terminated by pressing any mouse button other 
 than the first, see also identify.

set.seed(23235)
ss <- sample(1:150, 10 )
hc <- iris[ss,-5] \%>\% dist \%>\% hclust
dend <- hc \%>\% as.dendrogram

plot(dend)
identify(dend)

plot(dend, horiz = TRUE)
identify(dend, horiz = TRUE)
