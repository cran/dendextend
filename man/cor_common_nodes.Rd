\title{Proportion of commong nodes between two trees}
\usage{
cor_common_nodes(dend1, dend2, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend1}{a dendrogram.}

\item{dend2}{a dendrogram.}

\item{...}{not used.}
}
\value{
A correlation value between 0 to 1 (almost identical trees)
}
\description{
Calculates the number of nodes, in each tree, that are common (i.e.: that have the same exact list of labels).
The correlation is between 0 (actually, 2*(nnodes-1)/(2*nnodes), for two trees with 
the same list of labels - since the top node will always be identical for them).
Where 1 means that every node in the one tree, has a node in the other tree with the exact
same list of labels.
Notice this measure is non-parameteric (it ignores the heights and relative position of the nodes).
