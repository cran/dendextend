\title{Duplicate a leaf X times}
\usage{
duplicate_leaf(dend, leaf_label, times, fix_members = TRUE,
  fix_order = TRUE, fix_midpoint = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend}{a dendrogram object}

\item{leaf_label}{the label of the laef to replicate.}

\item{times}{the number of times we will have this leaf after replication}

\item{fix_members}{logical (TRUE). Fix the number of members in attr
using \link{fix_members_attr.dendrogram}}

\item{fix_order}{logical (TRUE). Fix the leaves order}

\item{fix_midpoint}{logical (TRUE). Fix the midpoint value.
If TRUE, it overrides "fix_members" and turns it into TRUE (since it must
have a correct number of members in order to work).

}
\value{
A dendrogram, after duplicating one of its leaves.
}
\description{
Duplicates a leaf in a tree. Useful for non-parametric bootstraping trees
since it emulates what would have happened if the tree was constructed based
on a row-sample with replacments from the original data matrix.
