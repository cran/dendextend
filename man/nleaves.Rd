\title{Counts the number of leaves in a tree}
\usage{
nleaves(x, ...)

\method{nleaves}{default}(x, ...)

\method{nleaves}{dendrogram}(x, method = c("members", "order"), ...)

\method{nleaves}{dendlist}(x, ...)

\method{nleaves}{hclust}(x, ...)

\method{nleaves}{phylo}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{tree object (dendrogram/hclust/phylo,\link{dendlist})}

\item{...}{not used}

\item{method}{a character scalar (default is "members"). If "order" 
than nleaves is based on length of \link{order.dendrogram}. 
If "members", than length is trusting what is written in the 
dendrogram's root \link{attr}. 
"members" is about 4 times faster than "order".}
}
\value{
The number of leaves in the tree
}
\description{
Counts the number of leaves in a tree (dendrogram or hclust).
}
\details{
The idea for the name is from functions like ncol, and nrow.

Also, it is worth noting that the nleaves.dendrogram is based on 
order.dendrogram instead of labels.dendrogram since the first is 
MUCH faster than the later.

The phylo method is based on turning the phylo to hclust and than to 
dendrogram. It may not work for complex phylo trees.

\examples{
hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests[1:5,]), "ave")
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)

nleaves(dend) # 5
nleaves(hc) # 5
