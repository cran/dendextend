\title{cutree for dendrogram (by 1 k value only!)}
\usage{
cutree_1k.dendrogram(dend, k, dend_heights_per_k = NULL,
  use_labels_not_values = TRUE, order_clusters_as_data = TRUE,
  warn = dendextend_options("warn"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend}{a dendrogram object}

\item{k}{numeric scalar (not a vector!) with the number of clusters
the tree should be cut into.}

\item{dend_heights_per_k}{a named vector that resulted from running.
\code{heights_per_k.dendrogram}. When running the function many times,
supplying this object will help improve the running time.}

\item{use_labels_not_values}{logical, defaults to TRUE. If the actual labels of the 
clusters do not matter - and we want to gain speed (say, 10 times faster) - 
then use FALSE (gives the "leaves order" instead of their labels.).
This is passed to \code{cutree_1h.dendrogram}.}

\item{order_clusters_as_data}{logical, defaults to TRUE. There are two ways by which 
to order the clusters: 1) By the order of the original data. 2) by the order of the 
labels in the dendrogram. In order to be consistent with \link[stats]{cutree}, this is set
to TRUE.
This is passed to \code{cutree_1h.dendrogram}.}

\item{warn}{logical (default from dendextend_options("warn") is FALSE).
Set if warning are to be issued, it is safer to keep this at TRUE,
but for keeping the noise down, the default is FALSE.
Should the function send a warning in case the desried k is not available?}

\item{...}{(not currently in use)}
}
\value{
\code{cutree_1k.dendrogram} returns an integer vector with group 
memberships.

In case there exists no such k for which exists a relevant split of the 
dendrogram, a warning is issued to the user, and NA is returned.
}
\description{
Cuts a dendrogram tree into several groups 
by specifying the desired number of clusters k (only a single k value!).

In case there exists no such k for which exists a relevant split of the 
dendrogram, a warning is issued to the user, and NA is returned.

\examples{
hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests[c(1,6,13,20, 23),]), "ave")
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)
cutree(hc, k=3) # on hclust
cutree_1k.dendrogram(dend, k=3) # on a dendrogram

labels(dend)

# the default (ordered by original data's order)
cutree_1k.dendrogram(dend, k=3, order_clusters_as_data = TRUE) 

# A different order of labels - order by their order in the tree
cutree_1k.dendrogram(dend, k=3, order_clusters_as_data = FALSE)
