\title{Sample a tree}
\usage{
sample.dendrogram(dend, replace = FALSE, dend_labels, sampled_labels,
  fix_members = TRUE, fix_order = TRUE, fix_midpoint = TRUE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend}{a dendrogram object}

\item{replace}{logical (FALSE). Should we shuffle the labels (if FALSE),
or should we replicate the same leaf over and over, while omitting other
leaves? (this is when set to TRUE).}

\item{dend_labels}{a character vector of the tree's labels.
This can save the time it takes for getting the tree labels (in case we run
a simulating, computing this once might save some running time).
If missing, it uses \link{labels} in order to get the labels.}

\item{sampled_labels}{a character vector of the tree's sampled labels.
This can help us if we wish to compare two trees. In such a case we'd like
to be able to have the same sample of labels used on both trees.
If missing, it uses \link{sample} in order to get the sampled labels.

Only works when replace=TRUE!}

\item{fix_members}{logical (TRUE). Fix the number of members in attr
using \link{fix_members_attr.dendrogram}}

\item{fix_order}{logical (TRUE). Fix the leaves order}

\item{fix_midpoint}{logical (TRUE). Fix the midpoint value.
If TRUE, it overrides "fix_members" and turns it into TRUE (since it must
have a correct number of members in order to work).

\item{...}{not used}
}
\value{
A dendrogram, after "sampling" its leaves.
}
\description{
Samples a tree, either by permuting the labels (which is usefull for 
a permutation test), or by repeated sampling of the same labels (essential
for bootstraping when we don't have access to the original data which 
produced the tree).

Duplicates a leaf in a tree. Useful for non-parametric bootstraping trees
since it emulates what would have happened if the tree was constructed based
on a row-sample with replacments from the original data matrix.

plot(sample.dendrogram(dend, replace = FALSE))
