\title{Cophenetic correlation between two trees}
\usage{
cor_cophenetic(dend1, ...)

\method{cor_cophenetic}{default}(dend1, dend2, method_coef = c("pearson",
  "kendall", "spearman"), ...)

\method{cor_cophenetic}{dendlist}(dend1, which = c(1L, 2L),
  method_coef = c("pearson", "kendall", "spearman"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend1}{a tree (dendrogram/hclust/phylo, or dendlist)}

\item{...}{Ignored.}

\item{dend2}{Either a tree (dendrogram/hclust/phylo), or a \link{dist} object (for example, from the original data matrix).}

\item{method_coef}{a character string indicating which correlation coefficient 
is to be computed. One of "pearson" (default), "kendall", or "spearman", 
can be abbreviated. Passed to \link{cor}.}

\item{which}{an integer vector of length 2, indicating
which of the trees in a dendlist object should have 
their cor_cophenetic calculated.}

\value{
The correlation between cophenetic
}
\description{
Cophenetic correlation coefficient for two trees.

Assumes the labels in the two trees fully match. If they do not
please first use \link{intersect_trees} to have them matched.
}
\details{
From \link{cophenetic}: 
The cophenetic distance between two observations that have been clustered 
is defined to be the intergroup dissimilarity at which the two observations 
are first combined into a single cluster. Note that this distance has many 
ties and restrictions.

cor_cophenetic calculates the correlation between two cophenetic distance
matrices of the two trees.

The value can range between -1 to 1. With near 0 values meaning that
the two trees are not statistically similar.
For exact p-value one should result to a permutation test. One such option
will be to permute over the labels of one tree many times, and calculating 
the distriubtion under the null hypothesis (keeping the trees topologies
constant).

Notice that this measure IS affected by the height of a branch.

\examples{

\dontrun{

set.seed(23235)
ss <- sample(1:150, 10 )
hc1 <- iris[ss,-5] \%>\% dist \%>\% hclust("com")
hc2 <- iris[ss,-5] \%>\% dist \%>\% hclust("single")
dend1 <- as.dendrogram(hc1)
dend2 <- as.dendrogram(hc2)
#    cutree(dend1)   

cophenetic(hc1)
cophenetic(hc2)
# notice how the dist matrix for the dendrograms have different orders:
cophenetic(dend1)
cophenetic(dend2)

cor(cophenetic(hc1), cophenetic(hc2)) # 0.874
cor(cophenetic(dend1), cophenetic(dend2))  # 0.16
# the difference is becasue the order of the distance table in the case of
# stats:::cophenetic.dendrogram will change between dendrograms!

# however, this is consistant (since I force-sort the rows/columns): 
cor_cophenetic(hc1, hc2)
cor_cophenetic(dend1, dend2)

cor_cophenetic(dendlist(dend1, dend2))

# we can also use different cor methods (almost the same result though): 
cor_cophenetic(hc1, hc2, method = "spearman") # 0.8456014
cor_cophenetic(dend1, dend2, method = "spearman") # 


# cophenetic correlation is about 10 times (!) faster than bakers_gamma cor:
library(microbenchmark)
microbenchmark(
   cor_bakers_gamma = cor_bakers_gamma(dend1, dend2, try_cutree_hclust=FALSE),
   cor_cophenetic = cor_cophenetic(dend1, dend2)   ,
   times=10
)

# but only because of the cutree for dendrogram. When allowing hclust cutree
# it is only about twice as fast:
microbenchmark(
   cor_bakers_gamma = cor_bakers_gamma(dend1, dend2, try_cutree_hclust=TRUE),
   cor_cophenetic = cor_cophenetic(dend1, dend2)   ,
   times=10
