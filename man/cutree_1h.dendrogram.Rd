\alias{cutree_1h.dendrogram}
\title{cutree for dendrogram (by 1 height only!)}
\usage{
cutree_1h.dendrogram(dend, h, order_clusters_as_data = TRUE,
  use_labels_not_values = TRUE, warn = dendextend_options("warn"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend}{a dendrogram object}

\item{h}{numeric scalar (NOT a vector) with a height where the dend should be cut.}

\item{order_clusters_as_data}{logical, defaults to TRUE. There are two ways by which 
to order the clusters: 1) By the order of the original data. 2) by the order of the 
labels in the dendrogram. In order to be consistent with \link[stats]{cutree}, this is set
to TRUE.}

\item{use_labels_not_values}{logical, defaults to TRUE. If the actual labels of the 
clusters do not matter - and we want to gain speed (say, 10 times faster) - 
then use FALSE (gives the "leaves order" instead of their labels.).}

\item{warn}{logical (default from dendextend_options("warn") is FALSE).
Set if warning are to be issued, it is safer to keep this at TRUE,
but for keeping the noise down, the default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{(not currently in use)}
}
\value{
\code{cutree_1h.dendrogram} returns an integer vector with group memberships
}
\description{
Cuts a dendrogram tree into several groups 
by specifying the desired cut height (only a single height!).
}
\examples{
hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests[c(1,6,13,20, 23),]), "ave")
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)
cutree(hc, h=50) # on hclust
cutree_1h.dendrogram(dend, h=50) # on a dendrogram

labels(dend)

# the default (ordered by original data's order)
cutree_1h.dendrogram(dend, h=50, order_clusters_as_data = TRUE) 

# A different order of labels - order by their order in the tree
cutree_1h.dendrogram(dend, h=50, order_clusters_as_data = FALSE) 


# make it faster
