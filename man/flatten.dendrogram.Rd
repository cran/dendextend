\alias{flatten.dendrogram}
\title{Flatten the branches of a dendrogram's root}
\usage{
flatten.dendrogram(dend, FUN = max, new_height, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{dend}{dendrogram object}

\item{FUN}{how to choose the new height of both branches (defaults to taking the max between the two)}

\item{new_height}{overrides FUN, and sets the new height of the two branches manually}

\item{...}{passed on (not used)}
}
\value{
A dendrogram with both of the root's branches of the same height
}
\description{
The function makes sure the two branches of the root of a dendrogram will have the same height.  
The user can choose how to decide which height to use.
}
\examples{
hc <- hclust(dist(USArrests[2:9,]), "com")
dend <- as.dendrogram(hc)
attr(dend[[1]], "height") <- 150 # make the height un-equal

par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(dend, main = "original tree")
plot(flatten.dendrogram(dend), main = "Raised tree")
}
