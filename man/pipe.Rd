\title{Pipe an object forward into a function call/expression.}
\source{
This is just the imported function
from the magrittr package. The documentation you should
read for the \%>\% function can be found here: \link[magrittr]{pipe}

Adding the function in the package while importing it
is a trick taken from the {dplyr} package
(in the file chain.r)

The package could have also been placed in "Depends",
But I wanted to keep it robust if at some point some other
package will try to take over the symbol (not likely, but still).
