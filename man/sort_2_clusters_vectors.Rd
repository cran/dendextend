\title{Sorts two clusters vector by their names}
\usage{
sort_2_clusters_vectors(A1_clusters, A2_clusters,
  assume_sorted_vectors = FALSE, warn = dendextend_options("warn"), ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{A1_clusters}{a numeric vector of cluster grouping (numeric) of items,
with a name attribute of item name for each element from group A1.
These are often obtained by using some k cut on a dendrogram.}

\item{A2_clusters}{a numeric vector of cluster grouping (numeric) of items,
with a name attribute of item name for each element from group A2.
These are often obtained by using some k cut on a dendrogram.}

\item{assume_sorted_vectors}{logical (FALSE). Can we assume to two group 
vectors are sorter so that they have the same order of items?
IF FALSE (default), then the vectors will be sorted based on their
name attribute.}

\item{warn}{logical (default from dendextend_options("warn") is FALSE).
Set if warning are to be issued, it is safer to keep this at TRUE,
but for keeping the noise down, the default is FALSE.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
A list with two elements, corresponding to the two clustering vectors.
}
\description{
Sorts two clusters vector by their names and returns a list with the sorted vectors.
